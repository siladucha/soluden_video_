# Product Overview

This is a **real-time video processing system** designed for motion detection and privacy protection. The system processes video files to detect moving objects, applies adaptive blurring to those areas, and provides motion analytics.

## Core Features
- Motion detection using OpenCV's BackgroundSubtractorMOG2
- Adaptive blurring (Gaussian, Median, or Bilateral) applied to detected objects
- Real-time motion density analysis and logging
- Multiprocessing architecture for efficient video stream handling
- Optional bounding box visualization for debugging

## Use Cases
- Privacy protection by blurring moving objects in surveillance footage
- Motion analysis for security or research applications
- Real-time video processing with performance optimization

## Target Users
- Security system developers
- Privacy-focused video processing applications
- Computer vision researchers and developers
